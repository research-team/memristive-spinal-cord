# Ankle-knee CPG modes description

The content of the interneuronal pool (IP) is inherited from the article (Dylan Deska-Gauthier and Ying Zhang, The functional diversity of spinal interneurons and locomotor control).

In this paper we will use the 5 layers approach for the pattern formation layer indicated as 5 CVs and OMs that works in flexor and extensor modes. The routing is done by the interneuronal pool indicated as the IP via iIP-E and iIP-F inhibitory projections. 

The diagonal inhibitory projections from iIP-F to eIP-F and iIP-E to eIP-E and iIP-F to R-E of both legs inhibit the synchronous activation of both legs left and extensors as well as left and right flexors. 

Lower we identify the difference between modes of the CPG work using 5 inhibitory nuclei: pattern blocking, CPG pattern routing, left-right legs synchronization and enhancer nuclei for the stairs and jumping modes.

## Walking

During the walking the knee inhibitory nuclei are inactive except for the blocking two that prevents the inhibition of eIP-F of both legs.
The ankle IP inhibitory nuclei: F-E Routing are active inhibiting the inhibitory projections from Ia-E to iIP-F used in knee IP to route the flexor pattern generated by OMs to extensor earlier than the cutaneous input from insole comes from CVs.

## Jumping 

![Jumping](diagram/cpg_AH_FE_combined-Jumping_8_muscles.png)

The main delta between walking and jumping is the activation of inhibitry synchronization nucleus that enables synchronous activation of extensors of both legs and left and right enhancers that inhibit the inhibitory nuclei 3 in all OMs.

## Stairs

![Stairs](diagram/cpg_AH_FE_combined-Stairs_8_muscles.png)

In stairs mode the enhancers are activated but synchronization inhibitory nucleus is not active.

## Running

![Running](diagram/cpg_AH_FE_combined-Running_8_muscles.png)

Running is similar to stair with the activation of enhancers to 50%.

## Turning right

![Turning right](diagram/cpg_AH_FE_combined-Turning_right_8_muscles.png)

The left leg enhancer is activated to 50% while the right leg enhancer is not active at all.
