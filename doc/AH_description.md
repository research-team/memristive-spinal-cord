# Ankle-knee CPG modes description

The content of the interneuronal pool (IP) is inherited from the article (Dylan Deska-Gauthier and Ying Zhang, The functional diversity of spinal interneurons and locomotor control).

In this paper we will use the 5 layers approach for the pattern formation layer indicated as 5 CVs and OMs that works in flexor and extensor modes. The routing is done by the interneuronal pool indicated as the IP via iIP-E and iIP-F inhibitory projections. 

The diagonal inhibitory projections from iIP-F to eIP-F and iIP-E to eIP-E and iIP-F to R-E of both legs inhibit the synchronous activation of both legs left and extensors as well as left and right flexors. 

Lower we identify the difference between modes of the CPG work using 5 inhibitory nuclei: pattern blocking, CPG pattern routing, left-right legs synchronization and enhancer nuclei for the stairs and jumping modes.
